# Arxiv Paper Fetcher and Summarizer

This project is a Python script that fetches recent papers from arXiv based on specified keywords, generates summaries and TL;DRs (Too Long; Didn't Read) in both English and Chinese, and saves the results in both JSON and Markdown formats. The README and the python file is generated by DeepSeek Chat.

## Features

- **Keyword-based Search**: Fetches papers from arXiv based on specified keywords.
- **Automatic Summarization**: Generates TL;DRs and full summaries in both English and Chinese.
- **Markdown and JSON Output**: Saves the fetched papers and their summaries in both Markdown and JSON formats.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Checks for and avoids adding duplicate papers based on author names.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `arxiv` Python package
- `tqdm` Python package
- `openai` Python package
- DeepSeek Chat API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arxiv-paper-fetcher.git
   cd arxiv-paper-fetcher
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install arxiv tqdm openai
   ```

3. Set up your DeepSeek Chat API key:
   - Replace `{YOUR API KEY}` in the `DEEPSEEK_CHAT_API_KEY` variable with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The script will fetch the latest papers based on the specified keywords, generate summaries, and save the results in `speculative_decoding_papers.json` and `speculative_decoding_papers.md`.

## Configuration

- **Keywords**: Modify the `KEY_WORDS` list in `main.py` to specify the keywords you want to search for.
- **Fetch Number**: Adjust the `FETCH_NUM` variable to change the number of papers fetched.

## Output

- **JSON File**: Contains all the fetched papers with their details and summaries.
- **Markdown File**: Contains a formatted table of the papers with links, authors, publication dates, and TL;DRs in both English and Chinese.

## Example

After running the script, you will find the output files in the same directory:

- `speculative_decoding_papers.json`
- `speculative_decoding_papers.md`
